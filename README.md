## This is a repository for the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) challenge.

Each directory will have its own `index.ts` file that will run the solution for that day, along with any input files and the puzzle itself in a text file.

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.1.38. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
